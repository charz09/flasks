Instructions:
There is a zip file 22020237.zip on the learning central or the Gitlab website. Unzip the file to have the 22020237 folder which has sub-folder called flask. The flask has directory for the flask web application as shown below:

flask/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── static/
  │   │   └── styles.css
  │   ├── templates/
  │   │   ├── base.html
  │   │   ├── index.html
  │   │   ├── security.html
  │   │   ├── quality.html
  │   │   └── usability.html
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   └── models.py
  ├── database.db
  └── run.py

using a window command prompt in a virtual environment, set the directory you are, for example, flask: "22020237\flask>".

Activate the virtual environment with window command, venv\Scripts\activate. This will change the status to "(venv) 22020237\flask>"

The next step is to set the flask_app into "run.py", that is, set FLASK_APP = run.py.

Lastly, run the flask with the command (venv) 22020237\flask>flask run.
